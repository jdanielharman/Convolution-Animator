# Convolution-Animator
 This is a simple python setup for creating arbitary convolution animations with the matplotlib animation library.
 
 ## Scripts
 Convolve.py is the file with all the functions.
 
 Convolve_to_gif.py is the driver code in a regular python script format.
 
 Convolve.ipynb is the driver code in a IPython notebook format.
 
 ## Source
 This code is not originally mine. I've changed and adapted it, but I didn't write the majority of the script. Here is the link to the original source code.
